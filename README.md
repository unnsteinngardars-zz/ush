A custom shell based on the following [shell writing tutorial from brennan.io](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

The purpose of this repository is solely to learn more about how shells work internally.
I plan on implementing job control along with redirecting of streams and piping.
